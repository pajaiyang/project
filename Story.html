                    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        There was a lounger near the window, with an incomplete painting on an easel nearby. The painting was of a young maiden (Kaitai),
                        in a pose semi-naked with a rose in her hands. However, TurLow noted where the picture was incomplete.
                        The rose had not been filled in. There was also a careless streak of red, running diagonally down
                        from the middle of the picture, to its bottom right corner.
                        TurLow asked if anyone had found the
                        rose. &quot; Sorry, sir. No one thought to look. &quot;	 Said a watchman, sheepishly. &quot; Never mind … Ah! Here it
                        is! &quot; TurLow knelt down and found a single red rose on the floor, near the lounger. &quot;	Hmm … looks like
                        he could have died before he finished painting the rose.&quot;	 &quot;	I bet the girl in the picture had a shock!&quot;	
                        the junior quipped. TurLow nodded. Then, he looked around. &quot;	So, where is she?” The congregated people
                        exchanged glances then returned blank looks to TurLow. TurLow started to think. He lent over Armand’s
                        corpse to examine it. He smelt a faint, yet distinctive smell. It was a thick, sweet smell with a
                        sharp, almost citrus twist. TurLow recognized it in an instant. &quot;	Poison. Blood of Nerrul, I believe
                        it is called. Someone really wanted Armand Conway dead.&quot;	 There was a murmur from the others. TurLow
                        looked over the corpse and noticed that the right index finger was covered in red paint. He sniffed
                        the finger and smelt the same smell. TurLow’s brow furrowed. He looked again at the painting, then
                        clicked the red streak. He moved over to the painting and smelt the red streak – there it was again,
                        the smell of the Blood of Nerrul. &quot;	The poison was in the paint. Very clever! Let’s see if we can
                        find the red paint pot … but, be careful, you don’t want to get near the stuff.&quot;	 TurLow and the others
                        searched the studio and the other rooms, but to no avail. All they found was a conspicuously large
                        splash of yellow paint, behind the lounger. Someone had taken the red paint pot. TurLow made a note
                        of the yellow paint. He checked Armand’s right hand again. Clearly, Armand was in the habit of biting
                        his nails. &quot;	So, that’s how he ingested the poison. Whoever gave him the poison knew he was in the
                        habit of biting his nails.&quot;	 &quot;	The girl?&quot;	 &quot;	Yes … but why? Did he pay his subjects well?&quot;	 &quot;	He did,&quot;	
                        the understudy answered, &quot;	very well. I can also vouch that he wasn’t sordid with them, either.&quot;	 &quot;	So,
                        if it was the girl, where is the motive?&quot;	 No one offered an answer. TurLow checked the wizard’s drawers
                        and chests  all seemed in order and there was no missing coins. In fact, there were some valuable
                        ornaments lying about. So, they weren’t talking about robbery. Armand was a quiet man, who kept himself
                        to himself and never dabbled in the politics of the Wizard’s Guild. so a political killing was also
                        ruled out. What then?
                    </p>

                    <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        TurLow looked into Armand&apos;s study. He regarded the scrolls, spell-books and notebooks with his watery blue eyes. Not much
                        made sense to him. Then, he picked up and artist sketchbook and flicked through it. There were a
                        number of well-drawn pencil sketches of various people; mostly pretty young maidens. An angry father
                        or lover, perhaps? TurLow saw a face that looked familiar. He walked back to the painting in the
                        studio. When he compared the sketches to the painting, he found many of them to match the girl in
                        the painting. Armand was keen on her! TurLow pointed this out to the others. &quot;	We need to find out
                        who this girl is, that’s for sure. Ryan, get out and about and ask the neighbours who this frequent
                        visitor was, will you?&quot;	 A young watchman nodded at TurLow’s order. TurLow continued to flick through
                        the sketchbook. He found more disturbing pictures of a young man – the only young man in the book.
                        The drawings depicted the young man in various reposes of death; hanging by a rope, stuck with a
                        sword and worse, besides. TurLow frowned – it’s always the quiet ones! However, there was something
                        about the young man&apos;s face that was awfully familiar. He couldn’t place where he seen it before.
                        Then, with a shiver up his spine, he realised how he recognised the man so much – the last time TurLow
                        seen the young man, he’d been as dead as in these pictures – with his piercing ice-blue eyes staring
                        sightlessly. One of the pictures was of the young man’s death mask exactly how TurLow had last seen
                        him. TurLow shuddered and slammed the book shut. &quot;	Sir,&quot;	 came the voice of the watchman, &quot;	I have the
                        name of the young girl, from one of the neighbours.&quot;	 A plump woman pushed through the crowd and gasped
                        at the corpse. TurLow went to her and ushered her out into the morning air. TurLow asked the neighbour
                        what she knew. &quot;	Her name is Owen, Owen Holiday. She lives in the Mercantile Quarter. Lovely looking
                        girl. She goes in Mr. TurWhom&apos;s pictures for a bit of extra money. Chatty little thing and always
                        very helpful. She’s a maid, y&apos;know? Nothing’s too much trouble for her. She&apos;s got a lovely smile,
                        but sad eyes. Mind you, it’s small wonder, what with her losing her young man, last summer. Such
                        a shame; he was gorgeous with those lovely blue eyes.&quot;	 TurLow raised an eyebrow. &quot;	Do you know where
                        she lives?&quot;	 &quot;	Oh, yes. Just across the way, on Jubilee Street.&quot;	 &quot;	I wonder if she&apos;d be home, with it
                        being a Sunday.&quot;	 &quot;	I doubt it. The poor girl is more likely to be near her man’s grave on a Sunday.&quot;	
                        TurLow thanked the woman. He turned to his junior. &quot;	Katai, come with me.&quot;
